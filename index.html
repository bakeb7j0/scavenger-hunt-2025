        <h3><b>How to Play:</b></h3>
        <p>You have 7 stops to make on your adventure.  For each step, you will receive and envelope with a QR code. Scanning the QR code will reveal a puzzle.  
            Solve the word scramble to reveal the second clue.  Using the answer to the word scramble, and the contents of the clue you revealed, you 
            should be able to quickly figure out where to go.  If you arrive at a business, head in, they are expecting you.  If you end up at a landmark,
            seach for another envelope, it will have instructions indicating what must be done at the stop, which will include sending an SMS to the group chat
            with proof of task completion.  Upon completing the stop, you will either be given
            a new envelope, or you will receive a new link in the group chat.  Lather, Rinse, Repeat until 5pm!
